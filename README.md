An exercise in database design


This was a website for club sports registration made with Eugene Moy as part of a Databases course at UVA. 

The most important part of the databases course, the designwork, is in the Documentation folder. We hand made the 
SQL, but exported stuff we stored from phpmyadmin.

We should've used stored procedures, but college.
